    <p>Hi there <i class="em em-wave"></i>, 
        this is Yassine! I'm currently a 3rd year PhD student, working on label efficient Deep Learning methods (semi-supervised, unsupervised
        and few-shot learning)  @ <a href="https://www.centralesupelec.fr/" target="_blank">CentraleSupélec</a> under the direction of 
        <a href="https://hudelotc.github.io/" target="_blank">Céline Hudelot</a> and co-supervision of 
        <a href="https://myriamtami.github.io/" target="_blank">Myriam Tami</a>.</p>

    <p>My goal with this blog is to share ML related things that I've
        learned & find interesting, that it is, in the clearest and most straightforward way without losing any substance.

    <p>If you have any questions or find any errors, please feel free to send me an email:
