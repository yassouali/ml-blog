    <p>Hi there, this is Yassine! I'm currently a 2nd year PhD student, working on label efficient Deep Learning methods (semi-supervised, unsupervised
        and few-shot learning)  @ <a href="https://www.centralesupelec.fr/" target="_blank">CentraleSupèlec</a> under the direction of 
        <a href="http://perso.ecp.fr/~hudelotc/" target="_blank">Céline Hudelot </a>. </p>

    <p>My goal with this blog is to share ML related things that I've
        learned & find interesting, that it is, in the clearest and most straightforward way without losing any substance.
