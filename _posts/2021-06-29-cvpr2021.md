The 2021 CVPR conference, one of the main computer vision and machine learning conference, concluded its second 100% virtual version
last week with a record of papers presented at the main conference. Of about 7500 submissions, 5900 made it to the decision making process
and 1660 papers (vs 1467 papers last year) were accepted with an acceptation rate of 23.7% (vs 22.1% last year).
Such a huge (and growing) number of papers can be a bit overwhelming, so to get a feel of the general trends of the conference this year, I will present in this blog post a quick look of the conference by summarizing some papers (& listing some) that seemed interesting to me.

*Note: This post is not a representation of the papers and subjects presented in CVPR; it is just a personnel overview of what I found interesting. Any feedback is welcomed!*

# CVPR 2021 in numbers
A portion of the statistics presented in this section are taken from [this](https://github.com/hoya012/CVPR-2021-Paper-Statistics) github repo & this [public tableau gallery](https://public.tableau.com/views/CVPR2021/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no).

  <img src="{{ 'http://127.0.0.1:4000/ml-blog/images/CVPR21/acceptance_rate.png' | absolute_url }}">
</figure>

The trends of earlier years continued with a 20% increase in authors and a 29% increase in submitted papers, joined by rising the number of reviewers and area chairs to accommodate this expansion.

<figure style="width: 60%" class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ 'http://127.0.0.1:4000/ml-blog/images/CVPR21/authors_by_country.png' | absolute_url }}">
</figure>

Similar to the last two years, China is the first contributor to CVPR in terms of accepted papers, followed by the USA, Korea, UK and Germany.

</figure>

As expected, the majority of the accepted papers focus on topics related to learning, recognition, detection, and understanding. However, the topic of the year is 3D computer vision with more than 200 papers focusing on this subject alone, followed by deep & representation
learning, image synthesis, and computation photography papers. There is also a notable increase in papers related to explainable AI and medical & biological imaging.


# Recognition, Detection & Tracking

#### Task Programming: Learning Data Efficient Behavior Representations ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13917))

<figure style="width: 100%" class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ 'http://127.0.0.1:4000/ml-blog/images/CVPR21/1.png' | absolute_url }}">
</figure>

In behavioral analysis, the location and pose of agents is first extracted from each frame of a behavior video, and then the labels are generated for a given behaviors of interest on a frame-by-frame basis based on the pose and movements of the agents as depicted in the figure above.
However, to predict the behaviors frame-by-frame in the second step, we need to train behavior detection models which are data intensive and require specialized domain knowledge and high-frequency temporal annotations. This paper studies two alternative ways to better use domain experts instead of a simple increase in the number of annotations: (1) self-supervised learning and (2) creating task programs by domain experts which are engineered decoder tasks for representation learning. 

<figure style="width: 100%" class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ 'http://127.0.0.1:4000/ml-blog/images/CVPR21/2.png' | absolute_url }}">
</figure>

Trajectory Embedding for Behavior Analysis (TREBA) uses these two ideas to learn task-relevant low-dimensional representations of pose trajectories
by training a network to jointly reconstruct the input trajectory and predict the expert-programmed decoder tasks (see figure above). For the first task, given a set
of unlabelled trajectories, where each trajectory is a sequence of states (eg, location or pose of the agents), the history of the agent stages is
encoded using an RNN encoder, and the RNN the decoder (ie, a [trajectory variational autoencoder or TVAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02813)) then predicts the next states.
As for the second task, we first need to create decoder tasks for trajectory self-supervised learning by domain experts (which is called the process of Task Programing).
First, the experts find the attributes from the trajectory data that are useful to detect the agents behaviors of interest, then write a program
to compute these attributes (eg, distance or angle between two interacting mice) based on the trajectory data using systems like [MARS](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.26.222299v1) or [SimBA](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.19.049452v2). These programs are finally used to generate training
data for self-supervised multi-task learning.

#### Permute, Quantize, and Fine-tune: Efficient Compression of Neural Networks ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15703))

One of the main challenges of deploying deep nets on mobile and low-power computational  platforms for large scale usage is their large memory and computational requirements.
Luckily, such deep netw are often overparameterized living some room for compression to reduce their memory and computational demands without a minimal accuracy hit.
One way to compress deep nets is scalar quantization, compressing each parameter individually, but the compression rates are still limited by the number of paramters.
Another approach is vector  quantization which compresses multiple parameters into a single code thus exploiting redundancies among groups of network parameters, but
finding the parameters to group can be challenging (eg, in fully connected layers where there is no notion of spatial dimensions).

<figure style="width: 100%" class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ 'http://127.0.0.1:4000/ml-blog/images/CVPR21/3.png' | absolute_url }}">
</figure>

The paper proposes Permute, Quantize, and Fine-tune (PQF), a method that (1) searches for permutations of the network weights that yield functionally equivalent, yet an easier-to-quantize network, (2) quantizes the permuted network, and finally (3) fine tunes the permuted-and-quantized network to recover the accuracy of the original uncompressed network. Since the second step consists splitting each weight matrix $$W$$ into subvectors (say $$d$$ elements per subvector) which are then compressed individually, where each subvector is approximated by a smaller code or centroid, the objective of the first step is to find a permutation $$P$$ of the weight matrix such that the construced subvectors are easier to quantize into codes (see figure above). The optimization of $$P$$ is done by minimizing the determinant of the covariance of the resulting subvectors (see the paper for why they do this). Finally, a fine tuning of the compressed network is conducted to remove the accumulated errors in the activations which degrade the performances.
